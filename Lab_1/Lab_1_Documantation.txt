4. Run the unit test
	a. check fixed done in build.gradle file
		Updating build.gradle to use modern Gradle configuration syntax resolved the build failure.
	b. check fix done in AppTest.java file
		The unit test initially failed due to a line-ending mismatch on Windows (\r\n vs \n). 
		The test was updated to use System.lineSeparator() to ensure cross-platform compatibility.
